# Smart City Simulator

To run the simulator is necessary to install Sim-Diasca, a general-purpose, large-scale, discrete-event simulator.

To install Sim-Diasca is necessary to install the Erlang Virtual Machine. It can run in a Windows environment, but it runs better in Linux, mainly in Fedora based systems.
