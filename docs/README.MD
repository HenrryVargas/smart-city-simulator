# SCSimulator - An Open-Source, Scalable Smart City Simulator

SCSimulator is an open-source, scalable Smart City simulator with the aim of simulate many Smart City complex scenario such as traffic management, waste management, and smart grids. This simulator is built on top of Sim-Diasca, a general-purpose, large-scale, discrete-event simulator. 

The Sim-Diasca programming model is easy to understand, it is required to implement an Erlang class (using Erlang WOOPER extension) to each actor that will be used in the simulation. The list bellow describes the actors included in each version of the simulation.

# Version 1.1

## BusStop

## BusTerminal

# Version 1.0
